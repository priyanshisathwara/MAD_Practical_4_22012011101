AIM : Create an Android Alarm application by using service & BroadcastReceiver.

About : 
The "Alarm App" for Android demonstrates setting and triggering alarms using a combination of services and BroadcastReceiver. 
This app allows users to set alarms for specific times, which are stored and managed by the app. When an alarm time is reached, a BroadcastReceiver listens for the alarm broadcast, 
which then starts a service to handle the alert notification, such as displaying a notification or playing a sound. The service ensures that even if the app is not active, 
the alarm will go off at the specified time. The app provides a straightforward user interface for setting, viewing, and managing multiple alarms, 
making it a practical example of using Android's background components to schedule and manage events efficiently.
